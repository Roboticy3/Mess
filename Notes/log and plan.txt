	 - made MeshGraph and DuplicateMap classes to wrap mdt MeshDataTool and duplicates Dictionary while handling mesh graphs and array to vertex data conversions respectively instead of BoardConverter
	 - realized the extent to which it is going to be a pain in my ass to implement MeshGraph searching into uv_to_mdata(). It will probably require a complete rewrite of Triangle.gd
	NEXT
	 - completely rewrite Triangle.gd to make sense with the current system of vertex arrays and reintegrate it into uv_to_mpos() and uv_to_mdata()
	 - fix raycast() so it always takes the closest point to the from point, not seemingly random intersections
5/13/2022
	 - found a shit ton of bugs with MeshGraph.gd and Triangle.gd

5/27/2022
	 - started preparing DuplicateMap to work with only partial sets of data as keys so normals and uvs do not interfere with its aggregated MeshGraph
	NEXT
	 - finish modifying DuplicateMap and set up MeshGraph to only consider positional duplicates when building its face and vertex sets
5/28/2022
	 - finished reimplementation of uv_to_mdata, DuplicateMap, MeshGraph, and mpos_to_uv. made my code slower in my attempt to make it faster

	 - graduate (get dressed, you have to go in like 30 minutes)
	 - start making the fucking game
6/3/2022
	 - tried to speed up get_connected_to_square()
	 - partially succeeded, making the algorithm around 6x faster but at the slight cost of it not working anymore
	NEXT
	 - figure out what's wrong with and fix get_connected_to_square() without bringing back the original complexity
6/5/2022
	 - completed the absolutely herculean task of fixing my own code
	 - optimizations are barely noticeable :(
	NEXT
	 - replace square_to_box() with shader-based method :(
	 - start programming taking phase
6/9/2022
	 - i am now 18 and have paperwork :(
	 - replaced square_to_box() with a shader-based method, it made me sad earlier to throw away all my math but it works so well that im ok with it. also, shader-based method has a really sick 2-pass shader with double-sided normals I love how it looks and it integrates right into the board's base shader
	 - restructured node tree to allow for Viewport based mpos_to_uv system
	 - created UvQuery.gd script to handle new Viewport system
	 - changed file structure to allow pieces to be organized into packs independently of boards

	 - started documenting syntax for writing pieces
	NEXT

	 - further test piece built-in variables
6/22/2022
	 - adjusted some code to make the px, py, fx, fy, ff, and opacity variables overridable

	 - fixed a bug where old mark sets on the board were overwritten by new ones, making mark indexes fail to be selected correctly when generating behaviors
	 - added functionality for conditionals to begin in the middle of instructions, not just the middle
	 - reworked Board.gd's g phase syntax to interperet teams as a persistent mode like symmetry
	NEXT
	 - continue documentaion of piece syntax

	 - had crisis about most instructions not being compatible with portals
	 - partially went through test list
	NEXT
	 - start designing a way to make instructions compatible with portals
6/29/2022
	 - made mark_step() have power over every square generated by the board, this should allow for portals to be computed within mark_step() and then for those changes to propogate out to any piece moves or behaviors.
	 - made "name" and "mesh" table variables for both boards and pieces
	 - started documenting board syntax. don't think I can finish it without implementing portals
