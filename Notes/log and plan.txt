1/21/2022
	- Made wrld_to_uv(), collider thickness intercepts ray and projects it from the wrong spot
	- Made Triangle class, includes lots of fun math functions that might be useful later
	NEXT:
	Make player camera controls, program piece model loader
1/23/2022
	- Made player camera controls
	NEXT:
	make uv viewer shader and square shader where uv's are adjusted by keybinds
	fix uv_from_board and wrld_to_uv
1/26/2022
	 - Stress tested the board creation process
	NEXT:
	>>1/23/2022
	Make BoardMesh model loader create a concave collision shape from ArrayMesh if possible
1/27/2022
	 - reworked collision shape system to work with concave meshes
	 - added quick way to switch to debug mode in wrld_to_uv
	NEXT:
	finish shader-based mode of approaching wrld_to_uv()
	program piece model loader
1/28/2022
	 - fixed half of wrld_to_uv(), learned that shader approach wont work because fragment() cannot send data
	 - learned how to use GLSL
	NEXT:
	find cause of and fix bug with wrld_to_uv() where some positions will fail to pass is_surrounding()
	program piece model loader
1/29/2022
	 - started piece model loader, BoardMesh keeps a cache of hard-to-load data on each type of piece and sends it to each of the pieces, instantiated as children of the board staticbody
	NEXT
	fix piece scale calculation to match piece AABB to its square (may have to be dynamic) add piece table param that lets users disable this
	add piece scale rotation to match the normal of the board on their square (maybe also allow user to disable this)
	change Player.raycast() to work with the piece collision layer of the player's team as well as the board
2/4-5/2022
	 - made piece model loader
	 - made implicit teams phase for default pieces 
	 - made symmetrize and no-symmetrize sub-modes for g phase
	 - began move() function
	 - changed forward vector and ff on pieces to be part of their table
	NEXT
	add implicit modes for every phase that pull from default
	use square_to_mdata, square_to_loc and dot product to create
	make AABB system for pieces 
2/6/2022
	 - started resolve_transforms()
	 - made intruction settings for pieces to resist transforms
	NEXT
	 - make square_to_box() to resolve a board square to a mesh
	 - use square_to_box() to cache selectable selectable squares and scale pieces
2/9/2022
	 - make screen_to_uv() like a chad
	 - that's fucken it
	NEXT
	 - make the scale component of resolve_transforms()
	 - start intruction interpereter
2/11/2022
	 - started square_to_box() again
	 - started update_scale() for PieceMesh
	NEXT
	 - finish system for converting uv square to mesh
		 - maybe change the system so that mesh is instantiated from intersecting faces and the "cropped" instead of trying to instantiate in the right shape as is
2/12/2022
	 - continued work on square_to_box()
	NEXT
	- TAKE A BREAK
2/19/2022
	 - took break
	 - continued work on square_to_box() (now shortening to stb)
	NEXT
	 - make stb match verts in outside to corners
	 - if outside is missing verts, add corner verts in new array and make matching indices in outside negative to distinguish from existing verts
	 - slide outside verts onto edge of two closest corners
2/20/2022
	 - fixed stb
	 - created edge set intersection with bound
	 - fixed square_to_basis() to work with broken team definitions
	NEXT
	 - finish stb by adding system to move verts inward and extrude into a box
