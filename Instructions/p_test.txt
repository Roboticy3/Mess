0 0 0 0 #these values indicate friendly fire and forward direction
pieces with a 0 for friendly fire will not have friendly fire on unless their team does
pieces with a 1 for friendly fire will have friendly fire
pieces with a null for direction will inherit their direction from their team's direction
	direction determines which way the piece thinks is forward, and all movements exist relative to it
pieces with 2 numbers in this section, separated by a space, will have their own custom forward direction
