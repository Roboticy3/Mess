#this phase creates the teams on the board, indicating their color in R G B format, the forward direction as two numbers
#and finally friendly fire as 0 for false and 1 for true
#setting the friendly fire parameter to 2 will make the team unplayable, which is sometimes the intention

0 0 0 0 -1 0 #create black team facing down with no friendly fire
#if two teams are declared with the same color, the most recent will replace the last

#this phase places pieces on the board, pieces are collected into an array via the paths below and called from 0 - n in the order they appear

default/p_queen.txt
